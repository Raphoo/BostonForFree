# BostonForFree
Boston for Free website created by Raphi Kang, Sohini Shah, Seyla Phan, and Zayba Qamar in a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program at Akamai.
This is our first website, and there isn't a lot of commenting done within the code itself... oops.

You can find it at bostonforfree.com, or contact us at gwc.girlswhocode@gmail.com.
